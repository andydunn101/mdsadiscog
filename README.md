The project was developed using both the [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Code management and deployment is managed by committing code git and the stored externally in [GitHub](https://github.com/).

All the code for this project can be found in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andydunn101/mdsadiscog) from where the website was deployed using git pages:

1. Log into GitHub.
2. Select "andydunn101/mdsadiscog" from the list of repositories.
3. Select "Settings "from the heading bar.
4. Scroll down to the GitHub pages section and in the "Source" section.
   - Click the drop down and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will be automatically refreshed and the website is now deployed.
6. Scroll to the GitHub Pages section and retrieve the link to the deployed website.

When the milestone project is submitted the development and master branches will be identical and no further changes will be made.

If you wish to run this project locally please seek permission due to the audio content deployed on the website. Local deployment can be done using the standard cloning method described in the GitHub article ["Cloning a repository"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) .

### General Testing and Outcome

The website was given to family members who use different devices to review and pass feedback to ensure it's viability. The main comments were missed images and iPad positioning of audio (see below). Image changes were rectified and retested. 

Tests were carried out on the following devices 

- Laptop.
  - Browsers - Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
    - Each browser using a different audio player -Spacing and centring of Audio. (see features update)
- iPhone 6 and 8 plus
- iPad and iPad mini
  - Issue not resolved on iPad - Spacing and centring of Audio. (see features update)
- Samsung Galaxy A50

All were informed that the contact page and social media sections would not be available for use.

All tests for functionality proved successful, but the placement of the audio requires some attention in the next release.
